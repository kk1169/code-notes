### 4. What is a decorator in Angular?

**Answer:**
A decorator is a special kind of declaration in TypeScript that can be attached to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter. In Angular, decorators are used to define components, directives, pipes, and modules, among others.

### 5. What is a module in Angular?

**Answer:**
A module in Angular is a logical boundary of the application. It is used to group related components, directives, pipes, and services. Every Angular application has at least one module, the root module, typically named `AppModule`.

### 6. What is the difference between `ngOnInit` and a constructor in Angular?

**Answer:**
- `constructor`: Used for simple initialization, dependency injection, and should not contain complex logic or initialization of the component.
- `ngOnInit`: Lifecycle hook called by Angular to indicate that Angular is done creating the component. It's ideal for complex initialization, such as fetching data from a service.

### 7. What is data binding in Angular?

**Answer:**
Data binding is a mechanism to synchronize data between the model and the view. Angular supports four types of data binding: 
- Interpolation ({{ }})
- Property binding ([ ])
- Event binding (( ))
- Two-way binding ([()])

### 8. What are Angular services?

**Answer:**
Angular services are singleton objects that get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. They are used to share data and functionality across components, encapsulating business logic and promoting reusability.

### 9. What is dependency injection in Angular?

**Answer:**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself, which enhances modularity and testability.

### 10. Explain the concept of Angular directives.

**Answer:**
Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. There are three types:
- Component directives: Define a component with a template.
- Structural directives: Change the DOM layout by adding or removing elements (`ngIf`, `ngFor`).
- Attribute directives: Change the appearance or behavior of an element (`ngClass`, `ngStyle`).

### 11. What are Angular pipes?

**Answer:**
Pipes are simple functions you can use in template expressions to transform data. Angular provides built-in pipes such as `DatePipe`, `UpperCasePipe`, `LowerCasePipe`, and you can also create custom pipes.

### 12. Explain the role of `NgModule`.

**Answer:**
`NgModule` is a decorator that defines a module, taking a metadata object that describes how to compile a component's template and how to create an injector at runtime. It provides declarative configuration of an Angular application.

### 13. What is Angular Routing?

**Answer:**
Angular Routing is a mechanism that allows you to navigate between different views or components in an Angular application. It enables deep linking, navigation, lazy loading, and guards to protect routes.

### 14. What is lazy loading in Angular?

**Answer:**
Lazy loading is a technique to load modules on demand rather than loading all modules at once. This improves the performance of the application by reducing the initial load time.

### 15. What is the difference between `ActivatedRoute` and `RouterState`?

**Answer:**
- `ActivatedRoute`: Represents the state of the router at a particular moment in time, including information about the URL, parameters, query parameters, and data associated with the route.
- `RouterState`: Represents the state of the router including all the active routes in the application at any given time.

### 16. Explain the `@Input` and `@Output` decorators in Angular.

**Answer:**
- `@Input`: Decorator to define an input property in a component, allowing data to be passed from a parent component.
- `@Output`: Decorator to define an output property in a component, which allows the component to emit events to the parent component.

### 17. What is the purpose of `ng-template`?

**Answer:**
`ng-template` is an Angular element used to define a template that can be instantiated later. It is not rendered in the DOM until Angular explicitly renders it.

### 18. What is the `async` pipe?

**Answer:**
The `async` pipe subscribes to an Observable or Promise and returns the latest value emitted. It automatically handles subscriptions and unsubscriptions, reducing boilerplate code.

### 19. What is Angular Universal?

**Answer:**
Angular Universal is a tool for server-side rendering (SSR) of Angular applications. It allows rendering Angular applications on the server, improving SEO and perceived performance.

### 20. What is the difference between `ngIf` and `*ngIf`?

**Answer:**
`ngIf` is a directive used without the asterisk, typically inside a component's logic. `*ngIf` is the shorthand for the structural directive, modifying the DOM by adding or removing elements based on the condition.

### 21. Explain the Angular lifecycle hooks.

**Answer:**
Lifecycle hooks are methods that provide ways to tap into key moments in an Angular component's lifecycle. Key hooks include:
- `ngOnChanges`: Called before `ngOnInit` and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change.
- `ngOnInit`: Called once, after the first `ngOnChanges`.
- `ngDoCheck`: Detect and act upon changes that Angular can’t or won’t detect on its own.
- `ngAfterContentInit`: Called after `ngDoCheck` and after Angular projects external content into the component.
- `ngAfterContentChecked`: Called after every check of projected content.
- `ngAfterViewInit`: Called after `ngAfterContentChecked` and after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.
- `ngAfterViewChecked`: Called after the view's change detection.
- `ngOnDestroy`: Called once, just before Angular destroys the component.

### 22. What is change detection in Angular?

**Answer:**
Change detection is the mechanism Angular uses to synchronize the model with the view. It checks for changes in the component state and updates the DOM accordingly.

### 23. What are Angular zones?

**Answer:**
Zones in Angular (provided by `zone.js`) are a way to automatically detect changes in an application. They capture asynchronous operations, such as HTTP requests, and notify Angular when to run change detection.

### 24. Explain the `RouterModule` in Angular.

**Answer:**
`RouterModule` is an Angular module used to configure the router service. It provides directives like `RouterOutlet` and `RouterLink`, and offers functionality for configuring and managing routes.

### 25. What are Angular forms?

**Answer:**
Angular provides two approaches for handling forms:
- Template-driven forms: Use Angular directives to create and validate forms.
- Reactive forms: Use a model-driven approach to manage form state and validation through `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, and `FormBuilder`.

### 26. What is a resolver in Angular routing?

**Answer:**
A resolver is a service that pre-fetches data before a route is activated. It ensures that the route component is initialized with the necessary data, enhancing the user experience.

### 27. What is the `HttpClientModule`?

**Answer:**
`HttpClientModule` is an Angular module that provides a simplified API for HTTP requests. It includes the `HttpClient` service, which is used to make HTTP requests and handle responses.

**Answer:**
`ng-content` is used to project content from a parent component into a child component. It enables the creation of reusable components with customizable content.

### 30. Explain the concept of `trackBy` in Angular.

**Answer:**
`trackBy` is a function used in Angular's `ngFor` directive to optimize performance. It helps Angular to track items in a collection by a unique identifier, preventing unnecessary re-rendering of elements.

### 31. What are `Subject` and `BehaviorSubject` in Angular?

**Answer:**
- `Subject`: An Observable that allows values to be multicasted to multiple Observers. It can emit new values, be subscribed to, and emit values to subscribers.
- `BehaviorSubject`: A type of Subject that requires an initial value and emits the current value to new subscribers.

### 32. Explain the concept of `Angular Ivy`.

**Answer:**
Angular Ivy is the new rendering engine for Angular, introduced in Angular 9. It provides improved performance, smaller bundle sizes,

 faster compilation, and enhanced debugging capabilities.

### 33. What is the purpose of `ViewChild` and `ContentChild`?

**Answer:**
- `ViewChild`: Decorator to access a child component, directive, or DOM element from the view (template) within the parent component class.
- `ContentChild`: Decorator to access a child component, directive, or DOM element projected into the component using `ng-content`.

### 34. What is the Angular `Renderer2` service?

**Answer:**
`Renderer2` is a service that allows you to manipulate the DOM in a way that is platform-independent, ensuring that your code works across different rendering environments (e.g., server-side rendering).
