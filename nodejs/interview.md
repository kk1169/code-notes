Sure, here are 30 Node.js interview questions along with their answers:

### Basic Questions

1. **What is Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server side.

2. **What is npm?**
   - **Answer:** npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It helps in managing dependencies for your application.

3. **Explain the concept of event-driven programming in Node.js.**
   - **Answer:** Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or message passing.

4. **What is a callback function in Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

5. **What is the purpose of `package.json` file?**
   - **Answer:** `package.json` is used to manage project dependencies, scripts, versioning, and metadata of the project.

### Intermediate Questions

6. **What are streams in Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** Streams are objects that allow reading or writing of data in a continuous fashion. There are four types: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform.

7. **Explain the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()`.**
   - **Answer:** `process.nextTick()` queues a callback to be invoked in the next iteration of the event loop, before any I/O operations. `setImmediate()` schedules a callback to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop, after I/O operations.

8. **What is the use of the `fs` module in Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** The `fs` module provides an API for interacting with the file system in a manner closely modeled around standard POSIX functions.

9. **Explain the purpose of the `cluster` module in Node.js.**
   - **Answer:** The `cluster` module allows for the creation of child processes (workers) that share the same server port, enabling load balancing over multiple CPU cores.

10. **What is middleware in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object, response object, and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.

### Advanced Questions

11. **What are the different types of HTTP methods supported in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** Common HTTP methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, and HEAD.

12. **How can you handle exceptions in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** Exceptions can be handled using try-catch blocks, error-first callbacks, promises with `.catch()`, and using central error-handling middleware in frameworks like Express.

13. **Explain the concept of promises in Node.js.**
    - **Answer:** Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They allow chaining with `.then()` and `.catch()`.

14. **What is the event loop in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** The event loop is a fundamental part of Node.js that handles asynchronous operations. It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations.

15. **How do you create a simple HTTP server in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:**
      ```javascript
      const http = require('http');

      const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.statusCode = 200;
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
        res.end('Hello, World!\n');
      });

      server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
        console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
      });
      ```

### Expert Questions

16. **What is the purpose of `async/await` in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** `async/await` is syntactic sugar built on top of promises, allowing for writing asynchronous code in a synchronous-like fashion, improving readability and maintainability.

17. **How do you manage environment-specific configurations in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** Environment-specific configurations can be managed using environment variables, configuration files, or modules like `dotenv`.

18. **What is the role of the `buffer` module in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** The `buffer` module provides a way of handling binary data directly in Node.js by providing instances of the `Buffer` class.

19. **Explain the concept of "non-blocking I/O" in Node.js.**
    - **Answer:** Non-blocking I/O allows other operations to continue while the data is being fetched or written, enabling higher efficiency and scalability.

20. **How can you improve the performance of a Node.js application?**
    - **Answer:** Performance can be improved by using efficient algorithms, optimizing I/O operations, using clustering, employing caching, and using performance monitoring tools.

### Coding Questions

    - **Answer:**
      ```javascript
      const fs = require('fs');

      fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(data);
      });
      ```

22. **How do you write data to a file in Node.js?**

### Conceptual Questions

26. **What is the difference between `require` and `import` in Node.js?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - `require` is used in CommonJS modules and is synchronous.
